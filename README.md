# hubitat-contactgroups
This app allows you to group multiple contact sensors or locks together as a virtual device so you can report a single status for a group. This can be useful for devices that have more than one contact sensor installed, or to group contact sensors, for example, in a room.
 
### Configuration
The name given to the child app will be the name assigned to the virtual device associated with the group. Within a group, the selected sensors will inform the state of the group. If all of the selected items are closed/locked, the group is closed/locked. If any of the selected items are open/unlocked, the group is open/unlocked.
